I can see you're working on the wherewasi project as part of your QRY ecosystem. Let me explore the current state and understand what you're building.

I notice this appears to be the qry_labs workspace, not the wherewasi project. Let me check if wherewasi is a subdirectory here or if we need to navigate to it.

Based on the search results, I can see that wherewasi is part of your QRY ecosystem but the project files (main.go, go.mod, etc.) mentioned in the context aren't in the current directory. Let me check if there's a wherewasi directory or if we need to navigate to the correct location.

I can see that the wherewasi project exists at `/home/qry/stuff/projects/wherewasi`. Let me navigate there and explore the project structure to understand what you're working on.

Perfect! I can see the wherewasi project structure. Now let me examine the key files to understand the current state and your "Ripcord implementation for instant AI context".

Now let me check the built executable to see if it's working:

Great! I can see the wherewasi tool is working and already tracking 13 projects in your ecosystem. Let me test the main functionality:

Perfect! The wherewasi "ripcord" is working. Your tool is successfully:

‚úÖ **Tracking 13 projects** across your ecosystem  
‚úÖ **Generating AI context** on demand  
‚úÖ **Clipboard integration** for instant deployment  
‚úÖ **Cross-project intelligence** with filtering  

**Current State Analysis:**

**üéØ Core Vision Achieved:**
- Instant AI context deployment (the ripcord works!)
- Cross-project ecosystem awareness 
- Local-first privacy
- Passive tracking ready

**üîÑ Active Features:**
- `wherewasi status` - shows 13 tracked projects
- `wherewasi pull --clipboard` - instant context to clipboard
- Time filtering (`--days`), project filtering (`--project`), keyword search (`--keyword`)
- Integration with QRY ecosystem messaging

**üìã Current Context Output includes:**
- Project location and focus
- QRY ecosystem context
- Recent commits (time-filtered) 
- Uncommitted changes
- Key files structure
- Cross-project search results
- "Ready for AI collaboration" deployment

**üöÄ What You've Built:**
A working "AI context ripcord" that eliminates the "explain my project again" overhead. When you switch between AI conversations or need to onboard a new AI assistant, you literally pull the ripcord (`wherewasi pull --clipboard`) and paste perfect context.

**Next Steps for Enhanced Ripcord:**
1. Background daemon for zero-friction tracking
2. SQLite persistence across sessions  
3. Smart pattern recognition between projects
4. Enhanced ecosystem integration with uroboro/doggowoof

You've successfully implemented the core ripcord vision! The "instant AI context deployment" is working.
