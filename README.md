**Micro Audio Transcription - Local AI Voice Processing**

Simple script for natural language processing using local AI and a decent microphone setup.

> *"But it works pretty well so far. I'm pretty happy."* - First successful test

## 🎯 The Vision

**Local-first audio transcription** that:
- Uses local AI (no cloud dependencies)
- Requires only a decent microphone
- Processes voice to text efficiently  
- Integrates with QRY ecosystem intelligence

## ✅ Proven Results

**First successful test output:**

====================
Hello.
So I've been doing a lot of general strategy talk today and one of these things was actually
starting this little thing called Micro, which is just a very small and simple script.
It can use to do natural language processing locally using local AI and nothing more than
a decent microphone setup and I guess a decent computer if you want to actually, you know,
record stuff properly.
But it works pretty well so far.
I'm pretty happy.

## 🧠 Ecosystem Integration

**Part of QRY ecosystem intelligence:**
- **Input**: Voice recordings, concepts, discussions
- **Processing**: Local AI transcription
- **Output**: Text for uroboro capture, wherewasi context
- **Storage**: Local files + clipboard integration

**Future integration:**
```bash
# Voice → uroboro capture pipeline
miqro record | uroboro capture --db --tags "voice-input"

# Voice → wherewasi context
miqro transcribe meeting.wav | wherewasi context --source "meeting"

# Voice → ecosystem intelligence
miqro process | ecosystem intelligence pipeline
```

## 🔧 Technical Stack

- **Audio Processing**: Local AI (likely Whisper or similar)
- **Dependencies**: Minimal, local-first
- **Output Format**: Plain text, clipboard ready
- **Storage**: Temporary files + permanent capture options

## 📊 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Accurate transcription** - demonstrated in first test
- ✅ **Clipboard integration** - immediate usability
- ✅ **Local processing** - no external dependencies
- 🔄 **Ecosystem integration** - planned for QRY tools

## 🚀 Development Status

**Current**: Proof of concept working, successful test completed  
**Next**: Formalize implementation, integrate with ecosystem  
**Context**: Born from need for hands-free input due to wrist pain

## 🎭 Origin Story

**The context loss that started it all:**
1. Built successful miqro transcription tool
2. Got excellent results
3. Completely lost track of which AI chat helped set it up
4. This frustration validated the entire QRY ecosystem vision
5. Used the experience to improve wherewasi and create this proper project

**Meta-learning**: Even context tool builders experience context loss!

## 🔮 Future Vision

**miqro as ecosystem input layer:**
- Voice → Text → Context → Intelligence
- Hands-free development workflow
- Audio meeting capture → project context
- Voice notes → automatic uroboro captures
- Accessibility-first design for RSI/wrist issues

**Status**: Successful proof of concept, formalizing implementation  
**Ecosystem Position**: Input layer for QRY developer intelligence system  
**Documentation**: Captured in qry_labs case study
