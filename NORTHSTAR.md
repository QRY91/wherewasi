# wherewasi North Star 🪂

**Last updated**: January 2025

## 🎯 The One Problem We Solve

**Stop AI context overhead from breaking developer flow.**

Transform project switching pain into instant context deployment. Pull the ripcord, get perfect AI context, back to building.

## 🚨 Focus Guardrails (Anti-Scope-Creep)

### ✅ Core Mission (Always Yes)
- Track development work across multiple projects passively
- Generate instant, dense AI context summaries on demand
- Cross-project intelligence with time and keyword filtering
- Local-first privacy with zero cloud dependencies

### 🚫 Tempting Distractions (Always No Until Core Is Perfect)
- ❌ Content generation features (that's uroboro's job)
- ❌ Project management or task tracking
- ❌ Team collaboration or sharing features
- ❌ Complex analytics dashboards or reports
- ❌ AI coaching or productivity optimization
- ❌ Plugin architecture or extensibility frameworks

## 🪂 The Ripcord Standard (Simple Truth)

**"Parachutes are invisible until you need them. Then they save your life."**

- **Ripcord speed over interface complexity** - instant deployment when needed
- **Passive tracking over active management** - works in background, invisible
- **Context over content** - provides raw material, doesn't generate output
- **Local-first over cloud-dependent** - your work patterns stay private

## 🏆 Competitive Advantage (Unique Position)

**We're the only tool doing cross-project AI context generation.**

Most tools: *Single-project focus, manual context creation, or cloud-based tracking*  
wherewasi: *Multi-project passive intelligence for instant AI collaboration*

**Positioning**: "The AI context ripcord for complex development ecosystems"

## 🎯 Success Metric (Single Source of Truth)

**The 10-Second Test**: "Can I get perfect AI context for any project in under 10 seconds?"

**Weekly question**: "Did wherewasi eliminate context setup overhead in my AI workflows this week?"

**Secondary metrics**:
- Time from `wherewasi pull` to usable AI context
- Cross-project context accuracy and completeness  
- Reduction in manual context explanation time

## ⚡ Core Workflow (Sacred & Simple)

```bash
# 1. Initialize (30 seconds, once)
wherewasi start

# 2. Work normally (passive)
# → Git commits tracked automatically
# → File changes monitored
# → Cross-project patterns learned

# 3. Pull ripcord (2 seconds)
wherewasi pull --project slopsquid --days 7
# → Dense AI context in clipboard
# → Paste into chat and build

# 4. Return to flow state
# → No interruption, no overhead
# → Perfect context handoff complete
```

## 🚫 Anti-Feature-Creep Rules

### Before Adding ANYTHING:
1. **Does this make ripcord deployment faster?**
2. **Can we improve passive tracking intelligence instead?**
3. **Does this maintain invisible operation until needed?**
4. **Would a flow-state developer want this interruption?**

### The Flow State Test
*If someone deep in coding flow can't get AI context in under 10 seconds and return to work, it's too complex.*

## 🔥 Context Quality Imperative

**The Real Differentiator**: Must provide genuinely useful AI context without manual curation.

**Quality Standards**:
- Context must be immediately usable in AI chats
- Cross-project relationships accurately captured
- Time-based filtering provides relevant scope
- Keyword search finds specific context across all projects

## 🎪 Current State vs. North Star

### ✅ Current Foundation (Working MVP)
- Basic CLI with `start`, `pull`, `status` commands
- Git commit tracking and analysis
- Project structure detection and key file identification
- Clipboard integration for instant AI handoff
- sjiek DNA integration patterns

### 🎯 North Star Simplicity
- **Pure ripcord operation** - invisible until deployment
- **Cross-project intelligence** - unified ecosystem awareness
- **Smart filtering** - time, project, keyword slicing
- **Ecosystem integration** - uroboro export, doggowoof context inclusion
- Core commands perfected: `start`, `pull`, `status`
- Background daemon for zero-friction tracking

## 🎨 Marketing Honesty Principle

**Underpromise, overdeliver.** Show the working ripcord, not AI buzzwords.

**Tone Standards**:
- Confident but honest about being solo development
- "Context generation" not "Revolutionary AI-powered intelligence"
- "Cross-project tracking" not "Enterprise ecosystem management"
- "Ripcord deployment" not "Instantaneous knowledge transfer"
- Parachute metaphor is our brand (it's perfect for the use case)

**Core Honesty Rules**:
- ✅ Show what's actually tracking and generating today
- ✅ Be clear about planned vs delivered features
- ✅ Confidence in the ripcord vision, honesty about current state
- ❌ No AI buzzwords for basic git parsing and file watching
- ❌ No enterprise speak for solo developer workflow tools

**Philosophy**: Build a tool that respects developer flow. Let people get AI context instantly so they can focus on building solutions. Good tools disappear until you need them.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Priorities

### Phase 1: Ripcord Mechanics (Next 3 months)
1. **Perfect the pull command** - instant, reliable context generation
2. **SQLite foundation** - persistent tracking across sessions
3. **Cross-project flags** - `--project`, `--days`, `--keyword` filtering

### Phase 2: Intelligence Enhancement (Months 4-6)
1. **Background daemon** - passive tracking without manual starts
2. **Pattern recognition** - relationship mapping between projects
3. **Smart summarization** - context density optimization

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration (If Phase 2 Succeeds)
1. **uroboro export** - context → content pipeline
2. **doggowoof context** - alert patterns in AI handoffs
3. **osmotic awareness** - world state context inclusion

## 🧭 When You're Lost or Distracted

**Read this section.**

1. **Does this make the ripcord faster or just more complex?**
2. **Would you trust this with YOUR AI workflow interruptions?**
3. **Is this solving context overhead or adding to it?**
4. **Does this maintain passive operation until deployment?**

**Remember**: Developers juggling multiple projects need instant AI context. Be the invisible parachute that deploys perfectly when pulled.

## 🔗 Relationship to QRY Ecosystem

**Complementary, not competing:**
- **wherewasi**: Provides context → AI collaboration
- **uroboro**: Captures work → generates content
- **doggowoof**: Monitors systems → alerts on problems
- **osmotic**: Processes world → maintains awareness

**Cross-pollination opportunities:**
- wherewasi context exported to uroboro for content generation
- doggowoof alert patterns included in wherewasi context
- osmotic world state provides environmental context
- Shared local-first, privacy-focused development philosophy

**Unified mission**: Tools that work quietly in the background, respect developer flow, and eliminate overhead without creating new friction.

*"Pull the cord. Get context. Build solutions."* 🪂

<!-- Note: The ripcord metaphor isn't just cute - it perfectly captures the emergency deployment of context when switching between AI conversations. The parachute is invisible until you need it, then it saves you from crashing. That's exactly what wherewasi should be. -->
